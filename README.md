<h3>Why the project?</h3>

The project aims to show the knowledge learned and generate a clone of the instagram profile bringing all my information as a Developer, some things are in the test phase and should be implemented in a short time!
All images have the right back to their creators, the project has no commercial purpose and if any creator doesn't want me to use their images, just ask me to remove them from the project
